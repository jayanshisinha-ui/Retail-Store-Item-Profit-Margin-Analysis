Retail Store Item Profit Margin Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing profit margins of retail store items using basic statistical methods in Python.
The goal is to compare profit margins across different product categories and gain insights into profitability, stability, and risk using numerical analysis and data visualization techniques.

The objectives are to:-
Calculate the profit margin (%) for each retail item , 
Perform category-wise comparison of profit margins ,
Compute mean (average) profit margin for each category ,
Compute standard deviation to measure variability ,
Visualize data using box plots ,

Profit Margin Formula used :-
Profit Margin (%) =((Selling Price − Cost Price)/Cost Price)*100
Mean and Standard deviation is also calculated and it is visually represented in a from of a box plot 

Technologies Used:-
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn

Methodology:-
1.Load dataset using Pandas
2. Add a column for Profit Margin
3. Group data category-wise
4. Calculate mean and standard deviation
5. Plot box plots to visualize variation
6. Interpret the findings

Real-World Relevance:-
This analysis helps:
Shop owners identify most profitable categories
Managers decide which items to promote
Repricing or replacing low-margin products
Understanding risk in high-variability items
Making business decisions using data instead of guesswork

Conclusion
The project clearly demonstrates how statistics and visualization can help solve a real business problem. By using Python and Pandas, we were able to easily calculate, compare, and understand profit margin data. This makes the project both practical and educational.
