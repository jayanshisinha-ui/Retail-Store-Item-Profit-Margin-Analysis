Retail Store Item Profit Margin Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing profit margins of retail store items using basic statistical methods in Python.
The goal is to compare profit margins across different product categories and gain insights into profitability, stability, and risk using numerical analysis and data visualization techniques.
The objectives are to:-
Calculate the profit margin (%) for each retail item
Perform category-wise comparison of profit margins
Compute mean (average) profit margin for each category
Compute standard deviation to measure variability
Visualize data using box plots
Profit Margin Formula used 
Profit Margin (%) =((Selling Price − Cost Price)/Cost Price)*100
